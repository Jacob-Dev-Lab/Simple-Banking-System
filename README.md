# 🚀 Simple Banking System - .NET Console Application
A clean, structured, and object‑oriented **banking system** built using **C# and .NET**.  
This project demonstrates my understanding of **software architecture**, **SOLID principles**, **file‑based persistence**, and **clean code practices** as part of my journey to becoming a professional .NET developer.

## 👨‍💻 Backend Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases practical knowledge of:

- C# object-oriented programming
- SOLID design principles
- Layered architecture
- Repository pattern
- Abstraction via interfaces
- Business rule enforcement
- File-based persistence
- Clean and maintainable code structure
- Separation of concerns  

Although implemented as a console application, the architecture mirrors production-style backend systems built with ASP.NET Core.

- Open Savings or Current accounts  
- Deposit and withdraw funds  
- View transaction history  
- Update customer profile (last name, email address)  
- Check account balance  
- Activate or deactivate an account  
- Input validation and error handling  
- State-based control flow
- Persistent storage of:
-- Accounts
-- Customers
-- Transactions

## 🧠 Concepts & Engineering Principles Applied

### Object-Oriented Programming

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Domain modeling

### SOLID Principles

- SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
Each class handles one clearly defined responsibility.
- OCP (Open/Closed Principle)
New account types or features can be added without modifying core logic.
- LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)
SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount behave consistently as Account types.
- ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
Interfaces are small, specific, and purpose-driven.
- DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)
Business logic depends on abstractions, not concrete file implementations.

## 📘 What I Learned
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Designing a multi‑layered .NET application 
- Structuring business logic independently of UI 
- Applying SOLID principles in real code  
- Building abstractions using interfaces  
- Implementing repository abstraction 
- Managing persistent storage  
- Structuring a clean and maintainable codebase  
- Handling user input and validation  
- Modeling real‑world financial operations
- writing readable and maintainable backend code 

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Replace file storage with EF Core + SQL Server  
- A web‑based version using ASP.NET Core  
- Add authentication and authorization

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is part of my journey as grow to becoming a professional .NET backend developer, focusing on writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

It represents my ability to design structured backend systems beyond basic CRUD implementations.
